// This is a common header file for extract-spmultifeatures.cc and
// best-multiparses.cc.  Its job is to include the header file that
// actually defines the real features.  If you decide to define
// a new feature set, redefine the include statement in this file
// to include that file.

#pragma once

// change this if you define a new feature file
//
#include "spmultifeatures.h"
